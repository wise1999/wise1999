### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Dominik from Poland and I'm still learing about coding and webdesign. I love that feeling when I devise something and then I'm putting it into code and it works. Actually I know most of HTML/CSS/SCSS/Bootstrap. I've learned flexbox usability and how to make good responsive design. Also I've learned how to implement custom themes into Wordpress. Most of my projects are on Wordpress, because I'm used to its funcions and I know how to troubleshoot. My main goal is to learn React and React Native to finally start building something really good, because currently I'm not glad about my skills. Maybe I will try to learn Adobe XD, but I don't know if I'll be good in making wireframing. I'd love to be better and grow up day by day.
